There are many nerve endings and endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. If your nerves and endocrine cells are more sensitive, they will respond to mild stimuli in the environment and cause gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therefore, gastrointestinal dysfunction is closely related to mental state, mental state, eating habits and sleep. Recommendations: Oral Peifeikang capsules can be used to regulate the intestinal flora (antibiotics can not be taken while taking drugs to regulate the intestinal flora), and trimebutine maleate tablets can regulate gastrointestinal motility and other symptomatic treatments. It is recommended that you mainly improve the disease through diet and lifestyle adjustments: 1. Regular and restrained diet regularly and quantitatively and chewing slowly is conducive to intestinal digestion and absorption, and avoid overeating; 2. Avoid irritating diets that are suspicious. Tolerate or allergic foods, such as shrimp, crabs, etc. try not to eat, spicy, frozen, raw and cold foods, supper, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee should be contraindicated; 3. Avoid high-fat diets that are light, easy to digest, and less greasy. High-fat diet can cause abnormal digestive function. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the intake of fat, especially the intake of animal fat; try not to eat fried food, chocolate, ice cream, cream, etc. Take it for 2 weeks to see the effect. If it is effective, take it for another 2-4 weeks. Stop the drug after the symptoms are basically improved; if the effect is not good, please promptly perform gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis before targeted treatment. The specific medications are: 1. Peifeikang capsules, 2 capsules at a time, 3 times a day; 2. Trimebutine maleate tablets, 1 tablet at a time, 3 times a day, taken with meals.

There are many nerve endings and endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract. If your nerves and endocrine cells are more sensitive, they will respond to mild stimuli in the environment and cause gastrointestinal dysfunction. Therefore, gastrointestinal dysfunction is closely related to mental state, mental state, eating habits and sleep. Recommendations: Oral Peifeikang capsules can be used to regulate the intestinal flora (antibiotics can not be taken while taking drugs to regulate the intestinal flora), and trimebutine maleate tablets can regulate gastrointestinal motility and other symptomatic treatments. It is recommended that you mainly improve the disease through diet and lifestyle adjustments: 1. Regular and restrained diet regularly and quantitatively and chewing slowly is conducive to intestinal digestion and absorption, and avoid overeating; 2. Avoid irritating diets that are suspicious. Tolerate or allergic foods, such as shrimp, crabs, etc. try not to eat, spicy, frozen, raw and cold foods, supper, tobacco, alcohol, and coffee should be contraindicated; 3. Avoid high-fat diets that are light, easy to digest, and less greasy. High-fat diet can cause abnormal digestive function. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the intake of fat, especially the intake of animal fat; try not to eat fried food, chocolate, ice cream, cream, etc. Take it for 2 weeks to see the effect. If it is effective, take it for another 2-4 weeks. Stop the drug after the symptoms are basically improved; if the effect is not good, please promptly perform gastrointestinal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis before targeted treatment. The specific medications are: 1. Peifeikang capsules, 2 capsules at a time, 3 times a day; 2. Trimebutine maleate tablets, 1 tablet at a time, 3 times a day, taken with meals.
